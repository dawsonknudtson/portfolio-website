To be Honest I have just started studying some ML - very basic stuff like Linear & Logitisc Regression, Feature Engineering, Gradient Descent, Cost Functions, Stuff Similar to that 

and I personally think that all this AI hype is nonsense for 2 primary reasons 

## 1. How An Actual AI (LLM) works

any LLM from my current knowledge works this way

- They are provided either scraped or given data
- Regurgitate Information / Predictions about that data
- Repeat

So Basically these large language models are using billions of billions of parameters or data either provided by google or wherever and it is just taking that data and making some good predicitions based off previous to solve you're current problem 

Let me give an example of my current understanding of how lots of the LLM's work, more specifically with programming 

- I give let's say GPT a prompt to program a certain feature
- It goes out, analyze's it's models training data (Lot's from Github, Stack Overflow or similar)
- Gives me a response based models data - nothing truly really new, it just was trying to match my prompt and it's(LLM) data to give me the 'Most Acurate' reponse

Now I could be 1000% dead wrong on this, but even if I am I think that my second point will be even to make this one irrelevent 

But now bringing me to my second point, which is 

## 2. Emotion's

LLM's cannot reason, they recognize pattern's which is good and ideal for things like trading, finding marketign trends, sucessful advertising. But bad for making logical decisions - especially production level code 

We have literally 0 clue on how brain work's we have never modeled part of the brain much less simulated it through computers

Plus think about what actually goes into making decisions. Lots of Raw - Human emotion - I personally feel that is something that cannot, and should not ever be replaced in workforce. 

AI can be good, it can free-up tedius jobs and encourage more creative - and collaborative work. 

As I mentioned before, I just started learning this stuff (Self-Studying) but from what I have seen so far that is general basics of how these Models & LLM's Work.
