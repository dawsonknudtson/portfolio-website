It might sound simple, but most people don’t realize how often they engage in activities where someone has to lose and often, it’s them. My goal right now is freedom: mentally, financially, physically. Over the last few years of building businesses, failing (still failing), and learning, I’ve become pretty good at spotting traps designed to drain your focus, finances, or peace of mind. These are the zero-sum games you should avoid

anyways, besides that here are a couple traps that I have experienced that hopefully you can avoid along you're journey

## 1. Gambling 

This first one obviously effect's a person finacially and it effected me for a little while, because I fell victim to pretty good marketing & "what everyone else was doing". I was introduced to gambling first in the form of sports betting. All my friends were doing it, and intitally it started out once every few weeks, to every weekend NFL game, then to every NFL game and then go different sports and so on. Now I was not a complete idiot - I had a bankroll, and only bet money I was fine loosing. And over the course of 6-months I ended up being profitible finacially, however I was still loosing.

The reason I was still looking was because it was taking away my most important asset's

## Focus and Dopamine

Reading that you might think what does Focus and Dopamine have to do with sports betting, let me explain.

To add context, During this time, I was in college studying computer science and that was the number one thing I was obsessed with and demanded the most amount of my focus. I have never been into the whole partying thing or drinking, but I still felt "left" out so I looked into other outlets - one of those being sports betting. 

But back to the whole focus thing, In order to be the best at what you do, You need to be fully submersed in whatever it is you are doing, for me at that time it was programming. In order to be the best version of myself and the best programmer I could be, I needed my focus. Unfortunately this was taking away from that and was robbing me of my attention and focus. 

On to my second point which is dopamine. My entire dopamine system was getting hijacked because of this, fully tuned into the games, stressing if a player would catch a football or if they would make a freethrow is not a healthy thing at all. To preface you're dopamine receptors work similarlly to how binary numbers work in programming 0 means it's bad and not good while 1's are super enticing and exciting to the brain, Unfortunately you're brain does not care at all how you get these ones and zeros. 

You could sit around playing video games and eating cake all day and you're brain is just recieving 1's all day long. It feels good and does not care at all how you got them. I feel I don't need to explain why this is bad, but to make it simple. This is really bad because when you sit down to do this 'less' exciting work besides video games or eating sweets and try to do things like reading a book, watching interview's from people who inspire you and can possibly assist in helping you become the best version of yourself or even just working on meaningful projects, It's going to be hard and virtually impossible because these things are not the same caliber as the previous. 

Alot of these are basically all tieing back to the root cause of why they are bad which is focus and dopamine, yes taken to the extreme all of these can destroy you're life(friends, family, finances, health, mental), and I have seen it first hand and trust me it is not a pretty sight to see. 

## 2. Social-Media / Scrolling

Alot of people reading this know that scrolling is not good, yet still do it. I am still one of the victims ocasionally, but what is the real reason why this is bad?

## Social Media Is Not Designed How You Think It is

Most people would assume that social media is designed to be interactive and collaborative with people from everywhere, while this is one feature of it. I feel that is not the intention of it, the intention is to get get you're attention, focus and engagement. Look at TikTok and Instagram reels, in a matter of 15-30 seconds you can be engaged and addicted to content based on you're data on what you personally like. Every platform has algorithims curated to you're liking whether you want to realise that or not. This system is literally designed to benefit the company not you, think about it, what good does you're interests affect towards these companies?

They don't, all they care about is if they can capture you're attention. Social Media is also zero sum because because their are lots of posers or liars more than ever on the internet. An Example is the huge market of courses, lot's of these "Gurus" flexing up next to a lambo or porsche wearing a rolex or RM or even just a seemingly "extravagant" lifestyle telling you the reason you are not sucessful or happy in life is because you dont have these material items & their 10k course can help you with that problem.

Absolute nonsense, I am all for self-education and learning. But when the basis of you're marketing is a portrayed lifestyle and flaunting. It is 9/10 a scam, majority of these courses is just regurgitated information from someone elses course in which those people even just took that information from the internet and books. I do believe specific knowledge is a thing but majority of the time it is scam, because if you are so smart and capable of making money, you wouldnt need to sell a course on how to make money. 

Plus just to add on, seeing everyone else's lives in only the good moments takes away from you're present moment. You started thinking to yourself "If only I had X" or "This person just went to X country, my life sucks and I am unhappy". Social Media enables this and I think that it is not good at all, my main purpose of social media is either education or slight entertainment(only sometimes). But overall I think it is a net negative that does not benefit you - even if you are a inauthentic influencer. Being unauthentic means you just have to perform like a circus bear to entertain the crowd. 

## 3. Caffeine 

Gonna make this one very short and simple, Caffeine at it's base is a suppressant, read any article or any book on it and it will tell you this. First it effects you're adenosine (part of the body for regulating heart function, Sleep and nuerotransmitter). In short this is the reason why you feel a crash after drinking any sorts of caffeine, because off of initial ingestion, caffeine blocks adenosine completely. Then when the effects start to wear off  you feel the crashing effects because all of the produced adensoine comes rushing into the body and brain making you super tired and fatigued.

Secondly, Caffeine spikes you're adrenaline (fight or flight). In short drinking caffeine sidesteps any sort of rational thinking in order for a faster response. This can be great when you are maybe stranded in the woods getting chased by wild animals, but not ideal for formatting spreadsheets at 9am. Also from personal experience I found that when I was most irritable and had the most anxiety was because of caffeine, 3-weeks after consuming no caffeine I was back to baseline and felt great - the energy was steady and I could think clearly throughout the day without crashing.

Last couples points to wrap this up is, In order to "feel" the affects of caffeine you have to keep ingestiong more. At its core, caffeine is a drug, If you consume it regularly you will build a tolerance to it. In order to get to the peak again, you have to cross that tolerance level. The more you consume the more it effects you. As like any drug, when you quit or stop consuming this stuff you start to experience withdrawl symptoms. From personal experience the first 1-2 weeks are complete hell, they sucks, I could not function. Companies know this, why else would they create this product?

Plus just the overall marketing and business model behind it sucks. Companies know they can create a can filled with chemicals for 50-75 cents and then resell that for typically 3-5 dollars, and people will buy it because it is addicting. It is the easiest cash cow in history, look at most energy drink companies they are pulling well over 50 million a year in revenue. No ever stops or questions it because "everyone" does it. What's worse is many influencers are promoting these products because of the incentives they get, and people fall it for which is the saddest part.
