As the title suggests, don't play zero-sum games. It may sound like basic advice, but when I look around at the people around me, I see them fall for these traps over and over again—and it’s like they don’t learn from it. Listen, I’m not perfect by any means, and I’m not bashing anyone. My #1 goal right now is freedom, and I want to see other people achieve their dreams too. If I can help anyone become the person they want to be, I’m more than happy to do that to the best of my ability.

Over the last 2–3 years of really focusing on myself, building businesses, and completely failing (and still failing, by the way), I’ve become good at spotting things designed to make you lose—whether in health, peace of mind, or finances.

Here are a few traps I’ve personally experienced that you might want to avoid on your own journey:

## 1. Gambling

This first one obviously affects your finances. I got caught up in it for a while because I fell for good marketing and did what everyone else was doing. I was introduced to gambling through sports betting. It started once every few weeks, then every NFL weekend, then every game, then different sports—it escalated quickly.

I wasn’t reckless—I had a bankroll and only bet money I was okay losing. Over six months, I was actually profitable. But I was still losing.

Why? Because it was costing me my two most valuable assets:

## Focus and Dopamine

Let me explain. At the time, I was in college studying computer science—my main focus and obsession. I never cared much for partying or drinking, but I still felt left out. So I looked for an outlet, and that outlet became sports betting.

To be great at something, you have to be immersed in it. For me, that was programming. But gambling started pulling away my attention and hijacking my focus.

And then there’s dopamine. When you’re constantly tuned into games, stressing over whether a player makes a free throw or catches a pass, your brain is getting flooded with dopamine spikes. It becomes a loop. You train your brain to crave high-stimulation experiences.

When that happens, trying to do low-stim but important things like reading, building projects, or watching a CEO interview becomes incredibly difficult. These things don’t compare in dopamine levels, and your brain resists.

When taken to the extreme, this loss of focus and dopamine sensitivity can destroy everything—your relationships, your finances, your peace of mind. I've seen it firsthand.

## 2. Social Media / Scrolling

Most people know scrolling isn’t good—but they still do it. I’m still guilty of it sometimes. So what’s the real problem?

## Social Media Isn't Designed How You Think

Most assume social media is for connection. That’s a feature, but not the goal. The real intention is to capture and monetize your attention. TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts—they all hook you in seconds with content curated by algorithms based on your behavior.

They’re engineered to keep you engaged, not empowered.

Social media is also zero-sum in a social comparison sense. There are more posers, scammers, and liars online than ever before. For example, look at the course-selling “gurus” flexing Lambos, watches, or vacations. They pitch you a fantasy lifestyle and claim their $10K course will solve your problems.

I’m all for self-education—but not when it’s marketing based on vanity and lies. Most of these courses are just recycled content from other courses or free stuff online. If they were so successful, they wouldn’t need to sell a course on how to make money.

And beyond scams, social media can make you feel like your own life sucks just because you're seeing someone else's highlight reel. It pulls you out of your own journey and makes you crave what others have. That’s dangerous.

Even influencers—especially fake ones—often feel trapped performing like circus animals to stay relevant. That’s not freedom either.

## 3. Caffeine

I’ll keep this one short. Caffeine, at its core, is a stimulant and a suppressant. It blocks adenosine—a chemical responsible for regulating sleep and energy. When caffeine wears off, that adenosine floods your system and you crash.

Caffeine also spikes adrenaline. That’s great if you're being chased by a wild animal, not so great when you're just trying to focus at 9 a.m. on a spreadsheet.

From personal experience, when I quit caffeine, my anxiety dropped and my energy stabilized. The first 1–2 weeks were terrible—I had withdrawal symptoms and couldn’t function. But after that, I felt amazing.

The problem is that caffeine builds tolerance. You need more and more to get the same effect. That’s addiction. And companies profit massively off it. It costs them pennies to make a drink, but they sell it for $3–$5 and rake in millions. Influencers promote it, people fall for it, and no one questions it.

These are just a few zero-sum games I’ve seen or experienced myself. The common theme? They rob you of focus, energy, peace, and purpose. And they’re everywhere.

If you’re serious about becoming your best self—avoid these traps. Stay focused, protect your attention, and don’t trade your future for a short-term high.
